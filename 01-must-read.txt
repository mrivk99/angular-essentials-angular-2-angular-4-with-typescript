Important - MUST READ

1) In the next lecture, we will need to install NodeJS (the Angular CLI, a tool we use for creating Angular projects, uses it).

You will learn how to install the Angular CLI and NodeJS in the next lecture but make sure that you DON'T download NodeJS version 18! Because at the moment, Angular doesn't work with that version.

Instead, download the LTS version of NodeJS. You can download that version via this link (use the "LTS" version): https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2) In addition, you might encounter dependency errors when creating new Angular projects.

This is a bug in the latest CLI version (13.1.0), published some hours ago:
https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22333
A fix is on its way:
https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22334
For now you can run npm i -g @angular/cli@13.0.4 as a workaround, and then create a new project with ng new.

3) When creating a new project with ng new, you should run it in conjunction with the --no-strict flag (e.g. ng new my-project --no-strict) and then answer the following questions:

1) Do you want to use the Angular Router?

2) Which CSS pre-processor do you want to use?

Choose these responses:

1) No (No router for now, we'll add it later)

2) CSS
